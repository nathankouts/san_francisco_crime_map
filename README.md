# San Francisco Crime Map
A map that shows 100 crimes that took place in the San Francisco area.
All the details are written in the Jupyer Notebook file.

Unfortunately the folium maps do not seem to render on GitHub natively so I will import them as a picture.

The map groups the incidents in neighbourhoods. The groups expand as we zoom in.
